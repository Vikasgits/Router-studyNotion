# Router-studyNotion
Study-notion is a website for coding knowledge. I tried replicating its Frontend working with help of javascript and its libraries namely ReactJS by dividing different parts into components. In this project, I also tried implementing the method of React Router which helps navigating in pages without triggering a whole reload of pages again.
